let's add another functionality to the skill. it should be able to setup the ralph-loop for the given tasks-ai tasks. 1) take a look at /Users/hacr/git-repo/ralph/ralph.sh which gives you the basic architecture , /Users/hacr/git-repo/ralph/README.md for the basic idea. 2) the skill should be able to setup the script for any new project, if I say something like "setup ralph loop for the project". The script should automatically detect if opencode is available and start the agent via opencode command using reasonable defaults. if there is a environment variable "TASKS_AI_AGENT" use that variable as agent instead. additionally to the original ralph script, our script should also accept '--model' as parameter to select the model which is used to implement the tasks. Update the readme. There are now 3 ways of using tasks-ai: 1) skill task managent + opencode plugin for full integration. please explain more detailled the advantages the plugi offers 2) skill for pure task management for the usage in any coding agent (e.g. github copilot cli also works). schedule the task in the way you personally prefer (e.g. asking the agent to schedule it  / within the agent) 3) real ralph:  add tasks via skill or bash scripts, schedule them with ralph loop (also works with any coding agent)
